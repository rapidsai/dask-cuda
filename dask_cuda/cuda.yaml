distributed:
  worker:
    # Fractions of device memory at which we take action to avoid memory blowup
    # Set any of the lower three values to False to turn off the behavior entirely
    device-memory:
      target: 0.60  # target fraction to stay below
      spill: 0.70  # fraction at which we spill to host
      pause: 0.0  # fraction at which we pause worker threads - Disabled (0.0) by default, preventing worker from stalling when third-party memory managers are used and can't be disabled
